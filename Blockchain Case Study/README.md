## Origin and Activities

In an era characterized by decentralized finance, a Canadian firm, BlockSteam, is poised to deliver new and blockchain-based financial and cryptocurrency services. BlockStream provides things like a BitCoin Wallet, API services relating to cryptocurrency prices, and a direct satellite feed to BitCoin that users can access without a traditional internet connection. <sup>[1](#myendnote1)</sup> BlockStream was founded in 2014 and its current leadership team includes Dr Adam Back, Erik Svenson, Lawrence Nahum and Samson Mow. <sup>[2](#myendnote2)</sup>

Since 2014, BlockSteam has raised $299M in funding.<sup>[3](#myendnote3)</sup> They have achieved this amount of funding from a variety of sources. They list their seed investors as AME Cloud Venture, AXA Strategic ventures, Digital Garage and others. News networks indicate that the firm is a Unicorn with a 3B valuation, and thus a suitable choice for further business analysis. <sup>[4](#myendnote4)</sup>

The next section will explore their product line and relevance in the fintech and blockchain spaces. 

## Products and the Democratization of Cryptocurrency

BlockStream is in the business of creating cryptocurrency and blockchain related solutions for both individuals and businesses. They offer up a new business model which includes a Liquid Wallet which claims to speed up bitcoin transactions.<sup>[5](#myendnote5)</sup> They also offer a cryptocurrency related API for historical prices as well as solutions related to BitCoin Mining. The company has also developed their own blockchain platform, called Elements. On Elements, users can build off the bitcoin protocol to execute transactions and spin up their own blockchains.  
 
The BlockStream Product line (as of Jan 2022)

Their product line is diverse, and spans cryptocurrency APIs, cryptocurrency wallets and an entire blockchain platform. They have also expanded into other related sectors, such as leveraging blockchain for energy sharing with a product line called BlockStream Energy.<sup>[5](#myendnote5)</sup> Furthermore, the company seems to wish to deliver on their promise to allow more democratization and expansion of global participation in bitcoin and blockchain technology. They are acheiving this goal by utilizing satellite technology to allow participants to access the BitCoin network by an independant satellite feed. This means that in areas where users are not able to access the BitCoin platform my traditional means, they can utilize the BlockStream Satellite.<sup>[5](#myendnote5)</sup> 

These types of developments in technology may indeed bring more underbanked and underfinanced persons into the realm of cryptocurrency and finance overall. If persons who are unable to participate in global markets via traditional internets can utilize this satellity technology, it may revolutionize the cryptocurrency markets. However, this is preliminary speculation and it is too early to see if this will come to fruition in a business sense. 

## Innovations and Disruptions

If nothing else, the BlockStream corporate ethos and their product line certainly has the potential to become powerful innovative forces in the field of fintech and blockchain. While some of their products are generic, like the cryptocurrency API, some of their products are fundamentally changing the structure of cryptocurrency transactions. Specifically the Liquid Network and the BlockStream Satellite are two outstanding developments that could speed up the BitCoin network and increase the number of participants in the global cryptocurrency community. 

Their company has experienced some setbacks however, such as the breakdown of the Liquid Network in 2021. BNN Bloomberg reported that the network crashed, while it was supposed to be facilitating faster transactions for Bitcoin. <sup>[6](#myendnote6)</sup> This may be an isolated setback, but it would be beneficial to patch the network because otherwise it may fail to deliver on its intented promise. If these issues can be overcome, then the Liquid Network could materialize as a key and potentially game changing element in the BitCoin ecosystem. 

Some of the BlockStream products and services are geared towards individuals, while some are decidedly rooted in assisting cryptocurrency mining and individuals in accessing the Blockchain and Bitcoin ecosystem. Therefore, they have the potential to disrupt and change the industry from the bottom up and the top down. 

## Conclusions

It's clear the BlockStream is creating and distributing revolutionary technology that will allow greater and faster participation in the fintech, blockchain and cryptocurrency spaces. There are products and services which have appeal to both the B2B and the B2C communities. They create and facilitate blockchain and cryptocurrency infrastructure, making it possible for more people to acheive more, in a smaller amount of time.
